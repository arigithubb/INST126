Welcome!

Today we will learn practice programming with files!

### Announcements
- Clarifications/reminders for Project 3 final deliverable
	- Submit problem formulation (even if unchanged, though you probably *should* be modifying it) with your final deliverable
	- Submit debugging report, using templates we have been practicing
	- Make sure to include the dataset (`.txt` file) you are using

### Game plan
- Files PCE, and Dictionaries too if time

### PCE notes

Q1 - file not found - was in a diff
shoretcut to the zip folder

Q2 - if you don't add the subfolder info, filenotfounderror
be careful that you don't forget the `/`

Q3 - what is `\n` and how do we get rid of it with `.readlines()`? fix: use `file.read().splitlines()`
