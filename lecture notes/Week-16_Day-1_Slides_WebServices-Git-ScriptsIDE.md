### Announcements:
- Happy last day of class!!!
- Reminder: extra resources for learning pandas
	- Biggest rec: find some youtube (playlists) that work well for you! Mean quality is *very high* - try to sample more recent ones to start with (or cross-check older ones against more recent ones in case features change; but core should be pretty stable)
		- https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python+pandas+for+beginners
	- AND! Join a hackathon/project (e.g., on https://www.kaggle.com/, or the UMD Data Challenge)

### Game plan

“Trailers” for:
- Programming in Python for the Web
- Version control / Github (guest virtual lecture from the Coding Train)
- Python scripts and IDEs (Sarah)

In prep for extra credit assignments on git

### Git

This is just a teaser! I recommend going through the rest of the playlist for Coding Train (he is an EXCELLENT instructor, esp. for folks who might not already have a traditional technical background, like many of us, myself included!).

To make some connections to what we've been looking at, let's also take a look at version control and git in:
- Our repository: https://github.com/joelchan/inst126-public
- Pandas! https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas

Bonus! "good first issue" (something to look out for if you're looking for more practice and building up your portfolio: browse open source projects for software/projects that interest you or you're using, and contribute!)

This, btw is a good way to also get a sense of how software engineers do debugging and problem formulation in the wild (without joining a company)! Free internship! :)

### Scripts and IDEs
