## Learning Outcomes

This is an introduction to programming for information science majors. This course provides a path for students with diverse backgrounds to successfully learn programming. You are not expected to have any computer programming experience.

You will learn how programmers analyze problems and design solutions for those problems using computational thinking, and practice using computational thinking to solve problems. You will learn how to implement computational solutions using the Python language ([https://python.org/](https://python.org/)), which is particularly well suited for common problems that information professionals seek to solve, such as data collection, analysis and management, and developing Web applications such as search engines. This is a hands-on course - both in and out of class you will be writing, analyzing, testing and debugging code, culminating in a project that tackles a challenging real-world problem.

Throughout the course, we will examine issues like algorithmic bias, ethical/unethical uses of algorithms and disparities in opportunities in tech jobs, which you need to understand to be an ethical professional and to be successful in your work. These issues reflect the broader social and cultural context in which we produce software. The social and cultural impacts of information and technology are central concepts in our discipline. Through readings, discussion and writing, we will critically examine how programming is situated in and reflects broader social and organizational structures, the ethical and equity issues this entails, and ways that we might address these issues as information professionals.

After successfully completing this course you will be able to:
1.  Explain fundamental programming principles, concepts and methods;
2.  Develop small-scale computer programs by applying fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, assignments, arrays, conditionals, loops, functions, and input/output operations;
3.  Test and assess the quality of small-scale programs;
4.  Write clear and effective in-code comments and other documentation;
5.  Apply computational thinking techniques to analyze problems and develop computational solutions;
6.  Explain how programming is situated in and reflects broader social and organizational structures, and the ethical and equity issues this entails. 
    
## Required Resources

ELMS: https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1320718 

This github repository: https://github.com/joelchan/inst126-public - will host the lecture notes and programming assignment materials. It is public at the moment, but you will need a github id to retain access after Week 2!

Laptop / computer with an Internet connection - The programs we will use are cross-platform, but you will need a stable Internet connection (of course, this also is true for accessing ELMS and lectures). Please contact me ASAP if you are concerned about this: I will do my best to work with you on an alternative solution.

## Course overview and expectations

### Structure and Rhythm
This course is organized in a project-oriented manner. The semester will be divided into four modules; in each module you will work on a **project** (and submit it by the end of the module) where you create a nontrivial program that solves some problem. For example, at the end of the first module, you should be able to create a program that solves a problem like computing recommendations for next steps in a degree program as a function of what has been completed so far. At the end of the course, you should be able to create a simple data cleaning and analysis pipeline to take a dataset of, say, income statistics, and produce some simple subgroup comparisons by race or gender. These are the main assessments of whether you are achieving the core programming competency-related learning outcomes for the course (i.e., learning outcomes 1 through 5 above).

To support your ability to create these nontrivial programs, we will also have **programming component exercises** that will test your ability with key component skills of programming. There will also be weekly **learning checks** that focus on factual, concept-level understanding that will be needed for you to advance.

Finally, in line with learning outcome 6 (on ethics and equity: a core component of your practice as a programmer), we will incorporate a pair of ethics assignments, paired with class discussion and activities, to practice the core skills and concepts that will be useful for you as you work to be not just a technically adept programmer, but an ethical professional.

A couple other things to note:
- This course will have *no exams*. Yes, you read that right! I’ve found that exams were empirically a poor predictor of mastery, and also introduced substantial overhead and anxiety that impeded learning. So, as noted, the core summative assessments of the course are your project submissions. 
- We will have an element of *mastery grading*. As I explain below in more detail, your programming component exercises will have an assessment approach that allows you to take multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery, as well as provide your more than one opportunity throughout the semester to demonstrate mastery (e.g., at a target milestone, or even later in the semester, with slightly reduced grades). 
    
Finally, a note on course structure: In general, the first part of each week will be conceptual/lecture-based, with a good helping of in-class interactivity. The second part of the week will be mostly in-class programming (mostly on the programming component exercises, with a good helping of paired work.

### How to Succeed

While I am trying to build in flexibility to account for the pandemic and the online nature of the course, I do recommend the following strategy as a way to reliably meet the learning outcomes by the end of the semester:

- Read ahead (see "resources" in the detailed course schedule) the week before, and try your hand at a few PCEs, and note where you're confused. A common failure mode is to focus on watching the lectures, without touching the exercises. This often results in unfounded beliefs that you’ve understood the material! Very often, it’s only by getting your hands dirty with the exercises that you really understand what you don’t understand, and are prepared to make sense of the lectures.
- Try to finish (or at least make a good attempt at) a PCE on the same week it is discussed
- Try to chip away at elements of your project each week
- Sign up for office hours and/or post questions on Discord if you're still stuck on something
- Help-seeking is encouraged, and we will explicitly teach how to do this well.

### 1: Projects (55% of final grade)

During each of the four modules of the course (see schedule below for more details), you will create a small-scale yet nontrivial program that solves an authentic problem. Each of these projects will emphasize application of the concepts learned in that module, while also building on concepts from previous modules (as real-world programming does!). As such, the projects will start small in scope, and gradually increase in complexity.

Here is a rough map of the four projects you will complete:

1. **Project 1** (10 pts; due the Monday after Module 1 in approximately Week 5,: Write code to solve a well-specified problem (chosen from a set of options). Example project: write a degree requirements analyzer that analyzes a set of input characteristics and activities and tells you what you need to do next to make progress on your degree in the next semester.
2. **Project 2** (12 pts; due the Monday after Module 2 in approximately Week 9; problem formulations due on Week 7): Formulate a briefly described problem as a programming problem (we will work together on how to do this: it’s a key skill for a programmer; choose the problem from a set of options), then write code to solve it. Example project: write an email parser that takes an email address as input, and gives you the main components of the email address (username, domain, server).
3. **Project 3** (15 pts; due the Monday after Module 3 in approximately Week 12; problem formulations due on Week 10): Propose your own problem (within a specified theme), then formulate it as a programming problem, and write code to solve it. Example project: write a program to create an index of which topics show up in which sections of an article.
4. **Project 4** (18 pts; due the Monday after Module 4 in approximately Week 16; problem formulations due on Week 14): Propose your own problem (within a specified theme), then formulate it as a programming problem, and write code to solve it. Example project: Write a data analysis pipeline that enables you to analyze labor income data by race and gender.
    
Some of these example projects might seem daunting to you. However, I want to assure you: if you follow along with what we do, and put in a good faith effort, you should end the semester with four nontrivial programs like these that you can put in your resume / portfolio, and a set of skills for completing projects like these and a library of reusable code that you can bring with you to INST 326, your internships, and wherever you want to go with your programming career.

Each project will be graded in terms of:
- **Correctness**: does the program adequately solve the problem posed for the project?
- **Logic**: regardless of execution, is the solution approach taken sound (i.e., likely to lead to a solution)? Note: this requirement can be satisfied even if the program isn’t working as a whole!
- **Style**: is the code written in a way that is understandable by other humans and amenable to analysis and debugging and maintenance (a key skill for real-world programmers)? For example, are the variable names clear? Are the key elements of the code clearly documented with comments so that they are reusable and debuggable?
    
As you progress through the semester, we will also look for more things in your project deliverables:

- **Problem formulations**. From Project 2 onwards. I will give feedback on this, but you will get credit for turning anything in. Of course, the more concerted your attempt, the better feedback I can give, and the better positioned you are to solve your problem.
- **Debugging reports**: documentation of key bugs or errors you’ve fixed or still encountering in your code for practicing skills in problem solving and debugging; another key skill for real-world programmers. From Project 3 onwards. I will assess the extent to which you have included a bug report that conforms to [certain parameters](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) (e.g., specifies what was expected, what was seen, a hypothesis for the cause of the error, and how to reproduce the error), consistent with [industry best practices](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) of debugging and bug reporting.
    
The final project package for each project will be due at the beginning of the next module (Monday at 11:59p EST). For example, according to the current schedule, the final code package for Project 1 will be due the Monday after the end of Module 1, i.e., 2/22 at 11:59p EST.

### 2: Programming component exercises (25%)

The projects will depend on your being able to write “component” code as building blocks, such as creating/updating variables, conditional blocks, iteration code blocks, and so on. You will practice your skills at these programming components with simple programming component exercises (on the order of 5-10 lines of code at most, but frequently fewer) that will give you immediate feedback on whether you are correct or wrong. 

There will be one set of exercises for each programming topic in the module; for example, Module 1 will have one exercise set each for variables and expressions, functions, and conditionals. Each exercise set will include immediate feedback through our autograding system, which we will explain in class. 

As mentioned above, this assessment will incorporate mastery-oriented grading. This means two things. 
1. First, you will be able to *attempt the exercises as many times as you wish*, and submit when you feel ready. 
2. Second, in addition to the usual late policy, *submissions will be accepted past the normal 5-day late work limit* (see section below on Missed Deadlines for more details) for up to 50% max points, until the end of the semester. 

I prefer talking about the "due date" for these assessments as "target milestone dates". At +1 weeks from the target milestone date, I will release solutions for the PCE sets for you to compare against and learn from. It is for this reason that the max value you can get for an exercise set completed after the +1 week mark is 50%.

At a high level, what this means for you is that you have many opportunities to get these exercises down. I’m doing this because not everyone learns at the same rate, and *I’d love to give you credit for learning even if it’s past my preferred timeline*! This is also technically feasible because of the autograding system we’ve set up.  So if you are able to reach mastery for all of the exercises in a set by the target milestone, great! That means you’re on track to an A for that topic. But if you manage to figure them out 2, 3 or more weeks after the milestone date, that’s ok too! You won’t get an A for that topic’s exercise, but you’ll still get credit if you solve the exercises! 

All that said, I still recommend that you try your best to complete each PCE on the week the topic is being covered, to give yourself enough time to get help for whatever you’re stuck on.

*NOTE*: Unfortunately, due to the way time works, this prorated grading will only be available for the exercise sets for the first three modules.

Each set of programming component exercises will be released at the beginning of each module at latest (my intention is for you to have access to the first two sets of exercises by the beginning of the semester, for those who want/need to work ahead).  

### 3: Conceptual learning checks (10% of final grade)

The projects will also depend on you tracking on basic concepts like “there are different kinds of errors; some will produce error messages from Python (syntax errors); others I have to find and fix through logic and analysis, among other things (semantic errors), or what a string literal looks like, or the parts of a dictionary data structure, and what kinds of data can or can’t go in a dictionary. These will be assessed in weekly multiple choice or true/false quizzes, due at the end of each week, on Friday 11:59p EST. 

### 4: Ethics Assignments (10% of final grade)

To assess your progress on learning outcome 6 (ethics and equity), we will also include two ethics assignments that will ask you to conduct to analyze the ethical and equity implications of a real-world programming project that resembles programming work you might engage in as you progress in your career. These will take the form of two brief (roughly 1 page) reflections (5 pts each) that explore questions like “What values are implicit in the design choices made for a specific programming project? What ethical implications and possible harms could come from design choices that may be technically equivalent or inconsequential? What concrete actions can I take as a programmer to produce not just technically correct but ethically defensible and societally beneficial programming products?”. 

## Grading

Grades are not given, but earned.  Your grade is determined by your performance on the learning assessments in the course.  If earning a particular grade is important to you, please speak with me at the beginning of the semester so that I can offer some helpful suggestions for achieving your goal.

All assessment scores will be posted on the course ELMS page.  If you would like to review any of your grades (including the exams), or have questions about how something was scored, please email me to schedule a time for us to meet in my office. I am happy to discuss your grades with you, and if I have made a mistake I will immediately correct it.  Any formal grade disputes must be submitted in writing and within one week of receiving the grade.

Your final grade for the course is computed using the learning assessments table below, converted to a letter grade. :

| Weighted Average | Letter Grade |
|--------------------| ------------|
| 97.0 and above | A+ |
| 94.0-96.9 | A |
| 90.0-93.9 | A- |
| 87.0-89.9 | B+ |
| 84.0-86.9 | B |
| 80.0-83.9 | B- |
| 77.0-79.9 | C+ |
| 74.0-76.9 | C |
| 70.0-73.9 | C- |
| 67.0-69.9 | D+ |
| 64.0-66.9 | D |
| 60.0-63.9 | D- |
| Below 60.0 | F |
 
Final letter grades are assigned based on the percentage of total assessment points earned.  To be fair to everyone I have to establish clear standards and apply them consistently, so please understand that being close to a cutoff is not the same as making the cut (89.99 ≠ 90.00).  It would be unethical to make exceptions for some and not others. I do not round grades up. I will *not* respond to email requests for a grade bump at the end of the semester. 

## Course-Specific Policies

### Missed Deadlines 
If you will not be able to meet an assignment deadline, contact Dr. Chan before the due date to explain why you will need to submit the assignment late and what your plan is; these will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and if approved, will not incur late penalties.
If prior permission has not been granted, your work will still be accepted. 

Because of COVID-19, you have 1 freebie late day for each assignment. After that, we will assess a late penalty of 5 percentage points for the second day it is late, 15 percentage points for being three days late, and 30 percentage points for being four days late, and 50 percentage points for being five days late. At six days late (and beyond), no points will be awarded for completion (except for Programming Component Exercises), but I am happy to still provide feedback. The increase in late penalty over time is meant to strike the balance between providing you opportunities to learn and managing the administrative costs of returning grades to everyone in a timely manner.

Please prepare in advance so that you will not encounter technical difficulties that may prevent submission of a given assignment. If you have a conflict with the due date, assignments can always be submitted early. 

### Collaboration, Group Work, and Academic Integrity
All of the individually graded assessments must be completed independently. You are welcome (and highly encouraged) to study and discuss the course material with your peers, but providing or receiving quiz/exam answers or letting someone else contribute to your writing assignment constitutes academic dishonesty. Penalties for academic dishonesty can include a 0 on the assignment or an automatic failure and “XF” on your transcript.

### Get Some Help!
You are expected to take personal responsibility for your own learning. This includes acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and doing something about it. Everyone can benefit from some expert guidance on time management, note taking, and exam preparation, so I encourage you to consider visiting http://ter.ps/learn and schedule an appointment with an academic coach. Sharpen your communication skills (and improve your grade) by visiting http://ter.ps/writing and schedule an appointment with the campus Writing Center. Finally, if you just need someone to talk to, visit http://www.counseling.umd.edu.

Everything is free because you have already paid for it, and everyone needs help… all you have to do is ask for it.

### Names/Pronouns and Self Identifications
The University of Maryland recognizes the importance of a diverse student body, and we are committed to fostering equitable classroom environments. I invite you, if you wish, to tell us how you want to be referred to both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit trans.umd.edu to learn more.

Additionally, how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity, is your choice whether to disclose (e.g., should it come up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.  I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly, and I ask you to do the same for all of your fellow Terps.
